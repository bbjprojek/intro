Hey there, my friend!

We just deployed this new frontend website for our main domain (bbjprojek.org). Although there is nothing really useful here, we just wanted to use it as a way of introduction for other people to know more about our organization.

## Finally, a Dedicated Page
We've been always thinking about launching our introduction website but we never did. The main domain page (bbjprojek.org), since the beginning, always redirected to our [documentation / handbook](https://wiki.bbjprojek.org) webpage, until today... :D

We've done several upgrades for our internal infrastructure lately but never launched something as simple as this. Not a blog, not a wiki page, just an introduction page, and it's finally here

## This is not a blog
Fyi, this is not a blog but a place to hold some useful and important information.

We have several ways to communicate public things in the organization;

- **Main Blog**: Which is located at [https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/blog](https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/blog)
- **Sergio's Personal Blog / The Authority Docs**: Which is located at [https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/blog](https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/blog)
- **XasPos**: A quick and convenient way to send, communicate and share information, product releases or any other thing with the whole organization or a selected team within the organization. Available at [https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/xaspos](https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/xaspos)

## Get to know us
You could check our ["about us"](/about) page where we explain in a nuthsell what we do in the organization.

You can chat with us in our public Telegram group where we are usually chatting about Android development, losing brain cells with kernels, dealing with dependences and having some fun talking about life.

So if you want to have a virtual beer with us, don't hesitate to join the group: [BBJProjeK The Authority (high unit variance)](https://t.me/bbjauthority).
