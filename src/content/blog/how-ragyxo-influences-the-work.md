[The Ragyxo Foundation](https://ragyxo.com) has been supporting us for quite some time now. Since the introduction of the RaBBAu Directives, also referred to as the "RaBBAu Internal Notes," our way of working has evolved significantly.

Ragyxo describes on its frontend page the process as "just requiring a little bit of finesse"—and that’s exactly what it is. Every time a new directive is issued, it impacts us in some way, whether it's through changes in our operational methods, technical tasks, or other aspects of our work as an organization.

## RaBBAu Internal Notes
We can define RaBBAu Internal Notes as a set of internal directives and updates for their clients among and other companies. These notes cover various operational aspects, such as privacy policies and legal advises, changes to infrastructure, legal compliance with copyright standards, and operational guidelines

They also address updates on team activities, like deprecation of domain content, operations and other internal builds and texts.

Each note is categorized by a number and year for easy reference. A research by external Ragyxo team of some publicly available non-so-internal notes can be found in [RaBBAu Internal Notes Research](https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes).

## Deprecations and smart storage
Storage and bandwidth are limited, so we can't just deploy and build everything we want and everything we see. Same situation with our cdn and website workers.

In this way, Ragyxo also advises on new potential deprecations, not only for possible storage issues but legal reasons. One of the latest RaBBAu directives explain why https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/ content is sunsetting on January 1st, 2024, among many other content.

## Customized guidelines and plan
Ragyxo team needs to know everything about the operation, globally. They accept just a limited amount of operations, custom-made ones. These types of operations are their passion, and involves a lot.

It's not a strategy or a bluff, it's simply that what they do in these operations is not scalable, it's authorial design and development, like home cooking, it doesn't come in a can.
