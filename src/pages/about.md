BBJProjeK was founded by <a href="https://github.com/thegabrielhoward">Gabriel Howard</a> and <a href="https://sergio.bbjprojek.org">Sergio Fern√°ndez</a> in late 2019. It started as a placeholder and software development organization incorporating a whole infrastructure for developers and designers to have a common place.

In the first place, the organization had focused manily in Android development (with Android 9 to 11) with projects such as <a href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/category/elementos/">ElementOS</a> but eventually turned in a multi-platform cabinet with projects such as tools for Windows and iOS apps development.

BBJProjeK is currently just a placeholder for miscellaneous projects and innovation, based in Getafe, Madrid.

## Products

BBJProjeK, as an organization, doesn't offer any product or service. Everything we do as an organization is completely <a href="https://git.bbjprojek.org">open source</a> and free.

We usually make designs for some business and companies, but again, completely free and without warranty. We make things in the organization as a hobby.

## Projects

Here are certain some notorious projects we did in the past years.

- <a href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/projects/rfi">RFIMadrid - Madrid Railway Network</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/tools/artwork/">Artwork Finder</a>

- The Candy's Workshop - Branding Design (October, 2023)
