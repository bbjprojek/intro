BBJProjeK was founded by <a href="https://github.com/thegabrielhoward">Gabriel Howard</a> and <a href="https://sergio.bbjprojek.org">Sergio Fernández</a> in late 2019. It started as a placeholder and software development organization, making an infrastructure for developers and other members of the community to have a common place.

In the first place, the organization had focused manily in Android development (within the era of Android 8 to 11) with projects such as <a href="https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/category/elementos/">ElementOS</a> but eventually turned in a multi-platform cabinet with projects such as tools for Windows and iOS apps development.

BBJProjeK is currently a placeholder for miscellaneous projects.

## Infrastructure
We have a modern and extended infrastructure for all member of BBJProjeK. We can highlight our [BBJProjeK Mail](https://mail.bbjprojek.org/), [XasPos Messenger](https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/xaspos/), our public messaging platform, or [BBJProjeK CDN](https://cdn.bbjprojek.org), where unlimited* storage can be used for plenty of projects and build hours.

Many of our infrastructure layout and guidelines are governed not only by our [Operations Working Group](https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/team/operations-working-group/), but recently by The Ragyxo Team and their [RaBBAu Interal Notes](https://ragyxo.com/partners/rabbau-notes).

You can learn more about different teams in our organization at the [BBJProjeK Handbook - Team](https://wiki.bbjprojek.org/docs/team/).

## Products
BBJProjeK, as an organization, doesn't offer any product or service. Everything we do as an organization is completely <a href="https://git.bbjprojek.org">open source</a> and free, and most projects are available at <a href="https://git.bbjprojek.org">GitLab</a>.

We usually make designs for some business and companies, but again, completely free and without warranty. We make things in the organization as a hobby.
